## Usage

### Prepare dataset

1. Download the dataset zip files un put all of them in
a folder. The following instruction need to be executed
from this folder.
2. Run script `01_unzip.py`
    * Notes: the scripts for data prepration are located
      in the `data` folder.
3. Run script `02_tif_to_hdf5.py`

Now, the zip files have been extracted to an `images` folder
and then put in a single file named `FuseMyCells.hdf5`.

### Run an evaluation

```
usage: eval.py [-h] [--use-gpu] --method {gaussian_filter,denoise_wavelet,denoise_tv_bregman} [--args ARGS [ARGS ...]]
               [--dataset DATASET] [--crop-data]
eval.py: error: the following arguments are required: --method
```

`python eval.py --method gaussian_filter --args sigma=0.5 --dataset FuseMyCells.hdf5`

## Method

Taking the [docker_template](https://seafile.lirmm.fr/d/233a5a399c8544dfb41a/) given by the organizer as a start point.

```python
from scipy import ndimage
if metadata['channel'] == 'nucleus':
    image_predict = ndimage.gaussian_filter(image_input, 0.442)
else:
    image_predict = ndimage.gaussian_filter(image_input, 0.5)
```

The filter sigma values have been manually selected from evaluation on the training dataset.
The evaluation process is done using `eval.py` and in our case usage of the `run.sh` script.
